# Cost Analysis

The main driver of this analysis is that "I" am an end-user of this design, and the ideal user will use it for ~1,000 hours. With that in mind and the fact that the electricity cost in San Jose [California] is around 15.59Â¢/kWh, one can see that a 1 watt wasted in the power supply is worth [1 watt * 1000 hours = 1 kWh] $0.155USD.
