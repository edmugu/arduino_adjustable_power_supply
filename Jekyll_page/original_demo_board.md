While doing tests on my board, I wanted to compare my design to the reference design shown in the article. So I decided to look for demo boards for the same components used in the article. AND I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT!!! I found the original board still being sold on mouser.com. So I bought one to be able to compare it to my board. Even after getting the board, I was still in denial, the article was written in the summer of 2014, and the demo boards were still being sold in 2021.

This made me feel great since I was able to tell that Analog Devices needed 3 revisions of this board to get this [simple design] right.
