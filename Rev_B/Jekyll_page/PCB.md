# PCB

Before I pick any case I wanted to "modularize" each of the stages to have an idea of how much space I needed. Also, to get better temperature readings of the MOSFET it seems that having two MOSFETS in "parallel" would distribute the heat propagated. And a thermal resistor could be placed in between, with some thermal paste, that way the temperature readings would be more accurate. 



At the moment, it seems that 2 inches x 2 inches will be good enough per stage [not counting heat sink area]. So I will probably need a case 10 inches x 4 inches. 



## Thermal sensors

In addition to having a single thermistor circuit, there will be another pair of resistors as reference. That way a differential pair can be made and the measurements will be more accurate. 



## Test points

I have been wanting to add proper "high speed" test points that are 50 ohms, so I could hook a high-end scope to the various stages of the design. Since connecting the 50-ohm probe to the voltage rails would overwhelm the controllers/regulators, I used a Ï€-matching circuit. The image below shows such a circuit below. Note that even R48 is not really needed, I left it for "good luck/practice."

## Encoders instead of Potentiometers

I have been also wanting to add encoders since they have an unlimited turn count. One for voltage and one for current limit.
