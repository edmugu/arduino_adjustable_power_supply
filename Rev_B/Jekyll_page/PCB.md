# PCB

Before I pick any case I wanted to "modularize" each of the stages to have an idea of how much space I needed. Also, to get better temperature readings of the MOSFET it seems that having two MOSFETS in "parallel" would distribute the heat propagated. And a thermal resistor could be placed in between, with some thermal paste, that way the temperature readings would be more accurate.
