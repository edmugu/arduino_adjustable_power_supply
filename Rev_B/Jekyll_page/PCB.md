# PCB

Before I pick any case I wanted to "modularize" each of the stages to have an idea of how much space I needed. Also, to get better temperature readings of the MOSFET it seems that having two MOSFETS in "parallel" would distribute the heat propagated. And a thermal resistor could be placed in between, with some thermal paste, that way the temperature readings would be more accurate. 



At the moment, it seems that 2 inches x 2 inches will be good enough per stage [not counting heat sink area]. So I will probably need a case 10 inches x 4 inches.
