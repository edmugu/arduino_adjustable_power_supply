# Intro to Simulation study 

I have learned that to do this right you have to use the SPICE tools of the pros [i.e. Texas Instruments and Analog Devices]. Their tools will have the proper model for the components they sell and the supporting comments they used. For this project I have found myself using LTspice a lot!
