# Intro to Simulation study 

I have learned that to do this right you have to use the SPICE tools of the pros [i.e. Texas Instruments and Analog Devices]. Their tools will have the proper model for the components they sell and the supporting components they used. So their SPICE simulations will be far better than the one I can do by importing or making models of the components I plan to use.
