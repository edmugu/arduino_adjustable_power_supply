## Bread board prototypes. 
After doing some sanity test on the new modules on a bread board, I wanted to do some stress testing. However, the plastic on the bread board can't handle over a watt of heat a transistor can generate while I tested the 10+ watt output I wanted.

## Perfboard prototypes. 
So I decided to do a success full stress test before I design the PCB for this project. So I moved to the perfboards that can take much more heat.
