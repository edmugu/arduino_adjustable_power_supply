# BringUp

Okay, after some debugging, the board could work through all of its stages. Moreover, after I closely looked at the voltage on an oscilloscope, they looked cleaner than I expected, except for the Voltage protection stage. There may be some backpropagation from Vboost, but that should not be an issue. However, one should revisit simulations to see if that is expected.
